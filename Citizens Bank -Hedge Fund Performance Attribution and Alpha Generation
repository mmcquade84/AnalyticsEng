Business Problem
Hedge funds invest in complex assets and use derivative trading strategies. Investors need detailed performance attribution to identify alpha-generating strategies.

Solution
Developed an Advanced Hedge Fund Performance Attribution System that:

Decomposes hedge fund returns into market, style, and risk factors.
Identifies high-alpha strategies that consistently outperform benchmarks.
Recommends portfolio reallocation based on factor-based performance.
Data Sources
Hedge Fund NAV Reports: Net Asset Value of hedge funds.
Factor Exposure Data: Market risk, momentum, size, liquidity factors.
Investor Transactions: Historical investment data.

SELECT 
    fund_id, 
    fund_name, 
    annual_return, 
    benchmark_return, 
    volatility, 
    alpha_coefficient
FROM hedge_fund_performance
WHERE reporting_year = '2023';

Identifies hedge funds that outperform benchmarks.
Calculates alpha to measure manager skill.

Step 2: Statistical Regression for Performance Attribution

import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Load hedge fund data
df = pd.read_csv("hedge_fund_performance.csv")

# Define factor exposures (market, momentum, size)
X = df[["market_factor", "momentum_factor", "size_factor"]]
X = sm.add_constant(X)  # Add intercept

# Define dependent variable (fund return)
y = df["fund_return"]

# Perform regression analysis
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()
print(model.summary())

Determines which factors drive hedge fund returns.

Step 3: Identifying High-Alpha Hedge Funds

SELECT fund_name, alpha_coefficient
FROM hedge_fund_performance
WHERE alpha_coefficient > 2.0
ORDER BY alpha_coefficient DESC;

Helps investors allocate capital to high-alpha funds.
Python-based performance attribution model.
SQL-based alpha ranking system.
Tableau visualization of hedge fund factor exposures.
