Business Problem
Structured products have complex pricing mechanisms and embedded derivatives. Investors need transparent risk assessments.

Solution
Developed a Structured Product Risk Model that:

Prices structured products based on market conditions.
Calculates risk metrics (Greeks, VaR, Expected Shortfall).
Provides scenario analysis for different market conditions.
Data Sources
Market Data: Stock, bond, and options market feeds.
Product Pricing Models: Black-Scholes for options pricing.
Investor Holdings: Positions in structured products.

Step 1: SQL Query for Structured Product Portfolio

SELECT 
    investor_id, 
    product_type, 
    notional_amount, 
    implied_volatility, 
    delta, gamma, theta, vega
FROM structured_product_holdings;

Helps analyze risk metrics for structured investments.

Step 2: Options Pricing Model in Python

import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import norm

# Black-Scholes option pricing formula
def black_scholes(S, K, T, r, sigma, option_type="call"):
    d1 = (np.log(S/K) + (r + 0.5*sigma**2) * T) / (sigma * np.sqrt(T))
    d2 = d1 - sigma * np.sqrt(T)
    
    if option_type == "call":
        return S * norm.cdf(d1) - K * np.exp(-r*T) * norm.cdf(d2)
    else:
        return K * np.exp(-r*T) * norm.cdf(-d2) - S * norm.cdf(d1)

# Example: Pricing a structured product option
price = black_scholes(S=100, K=105, T=1, r=0.02, sigma=0.25, option_type="call")
print(f"Option Price: {price:.2f}")

Helps price structured products with embedded options.
Python-based structured product pricing engine.
SQL-based risk tracking dashboard.
Monte Carlo simulation for structured product pricing scenarios.
